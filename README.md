<b>Mutual information (MI) for uniform and PCS 8-PAM. The symbol probabilities have been optimized to maximize MI for the AWGN channel under a peak power constraint. The Shannon capacity and McKellipâ€™s upper bound are also shown. The symbol probabilities obtained through the weight learning method achieve very similar MI to that obtained through the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.(./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_MI.png)</b>![](./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_MI.png)

<b>Mutual information (MI) for uniform and PCS 8-PAM. The symbol probabilities have been optimized to maximize MI for the AWGN channel under a peak power constraint. In addition to the Shannon capacity and McKellip's upper bound, refined bound is also shown. The refined bound is known to be tight in the range of 0 dB - 6 dB.(./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_MI_refined.png)</b>![](./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_MI_refined.png)

<b>Mutual information optimized symbol probabilities of 8-PAM constellation for the AWGN channel under a peak power constraint. The probabilities are shown for two peak SNR values where the optimal distribution does not have a Gaussian Bell shape. The symbol probabilities obtained through the weight learning method match well with those obtained using the Blahut-Arimoto algorithm.(./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_px.png)</b>![](./plots/AWGN_PPC_PAM8_px.png)
